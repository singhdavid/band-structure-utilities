# band-structure-utilities
This is hoped to become a collection of useful fortran utilities for band structure calculations. The current entries are a fortran code to flip spins in a wien2k charge density so that one can easily do different magnetic configurations and a code to process output from BoltzTraP to facilite plots with fixed doping levels.
